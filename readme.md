## 8BitDo Ultimate Controller Stuff

This repository contains random stuff I've collected related to 8BitDo's Ultimate controller.

Specifically the beta firmware is actually better for Linux since it allows explicit input mode selection through shortcuts similar to their pre-Pro 2 controllers:
Guide+West  - XInput
Guide+North - Switch
Guide+East  - DInput
Guide+South - Apple

Button explanation:
+--------+-------+--------+
| Layout | Xbox  | Switch |

| Guide  | Guide |  Home  |
+--------+-------+--------+
| North  |   Y   |   X    |
+--------+-------+--------+
| South  |   A   |   B    |

| West   |   X   |   Y    |
+--------+-------+--------+
| East   |   B   |   A    |

No license is available because it's 8BitDo's copyright, this repository is offered for the purpose of archival and allowing better use of the controller on Linux.
