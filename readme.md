## 8BitDo Ultimate Controller Stuff

This repository contains random stuff I've collected related to 8BitDo's Ultimate controller.

Specifically the beta firmware is actually better for Linux since it allows explicit input mode selection through shortcuts similar to their pre-Pro 2 controllers:

To select an input mode, hold one of these combos while the controller is off:
```
+--------------+---------+ +--------+-------+--------+
|    Combo     |  Mode   | | Layout | Xbox  | Switch |
+--------------+---------+ +--------+-------+--------+
| Guide+West   | XInput  | | Guide  | Guide |  Home  |
+--------------+---------+ +--------+-------+--------+
| Guide+East   | DInput  | | West   |   X   |   Y    |
+--------------+---------+ +--------+-------+--------+
| Guide+North  | Switch  | | East   |   B   |   A    |
+--------------+---------+ +--------+-------+--------+
| Guide+South  | Apple   | | North  |   Y   |   X    |
+--------------+---------+ +--------+-------+--------+
                           | South  |   A   |   B    |
                           +--------+-------+--------+
```
No license is available because it's 8BitDo's copyright, this repository is offered for the purpose of archival and allowing better use of the controller on Linux.
